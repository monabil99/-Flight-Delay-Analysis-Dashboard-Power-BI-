Number of delayed vs. on-time flights

Top airports and airlines with highest delay rates

Common causes of delays (weather, air traffic, carrier issues, etc.)

Delay trends by date, quarter, and time of day

📊 The dashboard helps identify performance gaps in the aviation industry and provides a clear view of delay patterns that impact travelers and airline operations
